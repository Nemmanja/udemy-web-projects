# Web Development Projects

This repository contains a collection of my web development projects created while following along Angela Yu's "The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy.

Projects range from simple frontend applications to more complex full-stack solutions. Each project is organized in its own folder.

(More projects will be added over time.)

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- jQuery
- React
- Node.js
- Express
- PostgreSQL

Before running these projects, make sure you have PostgreSQL up and running.
After opening the project, open the terminal and cd into the chosen folder.
Type in npm i to download all node dependencies.
If you don't have node, make sure you install it.
